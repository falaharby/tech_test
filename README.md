A Project for Technical Test - A Job Thing

## Question

- What kind of architecture did you use?
>   Architecture that i use is BLoC Pattern


- What libraries did you add to the app? What are they used for? if you not rely the other library tell us why?
>   - dio => Libraries for fetch API
>   - RxDart => Libraries for reactive asynchronous stream data
>   - intl => Libraries for Formating date
>   - flutter_email_sender => Libraries for sending email
>   - url_launcher => Libraries for opening an url that i use for sending Whatsapp message


- How long did you spend on the test?
>   2 days and 6 hours


- If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
>   I would learn more about RxDart and apply it to apps with more properly and perfectfully.
>   because this is my first time use it and there's not much tutorial about RxDart.
>   so i would happily if i can implement more properly about RxDart.


- Which parts of your submission are you most proud of? And why? little advice, dont answer whole project, use one what you think it special.
>   The most i proud of is when i successfull to combine multiple stream with RxDart for fetch API and other logic.
>   Because this is the core of all parts, and i feel proud because my knowledge gain more.
>   Before this, i always use Provider which is not Stream based state management, so RxDart and Stream was a something new to me.


- Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
>   The most part i spent is absolutely about using RxDart properly for Fetching API and other function and implement it to streams and combine it into 1 stream.
>   Before going through layouting UI, i'd learn and research about RxDart for about 6 hours.


- How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them, please elaborate more about this.
>   The test is good for testing any job applicant. But i think the API need more realistically like for getting details maybe we can use url like candidates/$id not filter manually.
>   And there's miss point about "wire-frame below" and i didn't see any wire-frame below.


- The last question, quality or quantity?
>   Quality.
